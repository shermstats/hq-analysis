## Introduction

HQ Trivia is a fun trivia app.  Each question has three possible
answer choices, and a standard game has a grand prize of $2500 that is
split among the winners.

I'll be looking at HQ Trivia questions in two ways: As collections of
text that cover a variety of topics, and as questions that are varying
levels of difficulty based on the number of players who correctly
answer them.
